      "body": "I was reminded of the topic because I was looking at the Beatles' billboard charts and realized that 'Come Together' was the A side to the Abbey Road single with 'Something' as the B side. I know that 'Something' has always gotten the love it deserves, but in my opinion it is REALLY carrying that single. I don't think 'Come Together' is a bad song, but I do believe it is overrated and the least interesting song on the album.",
